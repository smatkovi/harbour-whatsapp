%changelog
* Sun Jul 12 2026 smatkovi <smatkovi@users.noreply.github.com> 0.4.7-1
- Fix wrong contact name shown on chats: local contact matching now
  canonicalizes both numbers to full international form (using your
  account's country code) and requires an exact match; the loose
  suffix fallback only applies with at least 9 matching digits and
  never overrides an exact match

* Sun Jul 12 2026 smatkovi <smatkovi@users.noreply.github.com> 0.4.6-1
- Fix chats failing to open (silently) with "TypeError: Property
  'endsWith' ... is not a function": String.endsWith is ES6 and not
  available in the Qt 5.6 QML engine on Sailfish OS; contact name
  matching now uses a compatible suffix check and also handles
  numeric phoneDetails values
- Suffix matching of phone numbers now requires at least 6 digits on
  both sides, avoiding false contact-name matches on short numbers

* Sun Jul 12 2026 smatkovi <smatkovi@users.noreply.github.com> 0.4.5-1
- Fix local address book contacts not showing up on the "New chat" page
  ("No contacts accessible"): the app now requests the Privileged
  permission in addition to Contacts, like other Sailjail apps with
  working contact access (e.g. Fernschreiber). Without it, qtcontacts
  only sees the non-privileged contacts database, which is empty on
  many installations. Sandboxing stays fully enabled.

* Sun Jul 12 2026 smatkovi <smatkovi@users.noreply.github.com> 0.4.4-1
- "New chat" now lists your local Sailfish address book (via PeopleModel)
  merged with your WhatsApp contacts, searchable by name or number, with
  a WhatsApp badge on contacts known to be on WhatsApp
- Local numbers are normalized automatically ("+43...", "0043...", and
  national "0676..." formats all resolve to the right WhatsApp number,
  using your own account's country code)
- Clear hint on the "New chat" page if no contacts are accessible

* Sun Jul 12 2026 smatkovi <smatkovi@users.noreply.github.com> 0.4.3-1
- The header now shows a meaningful connection status instead of just
  "Not connected": starting, connecting, reconnecting, waiting for
  pairing, logged out - and the actual error reason if the connection
  fails (e.g. "client outdated", "stream replaced", temporary ban)
- Backend exposes connection state and last error via the /status
  endpoint and handles ConnectFailure, ClientOutdated, StreamReplaced,
  TemporaryBan and Disconnected events

* Sun Jul 12 2026 smatkovi <smatkovi@users.noreply.github.com> 0.4.2-1
- Phone number input is now normalized automatically: "+", spaces, dashes
  and a leading "00" are stripped, so entering e.g. "+43 664..." for
  pairing just works instead of silently registering a wrong number
- Backend now binds to 127.0.0.1 only - previously the message API was
  reachable from the local network, which was a security problem
- If port 8085 is taken, the backend now falls back to 8086-8089 and the
  app follows automatically, instead of failing silently with
  "Could not connect to server"
- The app now shows an error message with the log file location if the
  backend fails to start

* Sun Jul 12 2026 smatkovi <smatkovi@users.noreply.github.com> 0.4.1-1
- First armv7hl (32-bit) build, for devices like the Xperia X / XA2 running
  32-bit Sailfish OS. "Could not connect to localhost port 8085" on those
  devices was caused by the 64-bit backend binary not being able to start
- Backend output is now logged to
  ~/.local/share/harbour/harbour-whatsapp/backend.log instead of being
  discarded, so problems are much easier to report and diagnose

* Sun Jul 12 2026 smatkovi <smatkovi@users.noreply.github.com> 0.4.0-1
- Fix login/session data being lost on every app restart: the backend data
  directory is now the Sailjail-persistent path
  ~/.local/share/harbour/harbour-whatsapp (existing data is migrated
  automatically on first start; thanks rdomschk and kempertom!)
- Fix incoming messages sometimes not matching the existing chat and
  showing up as a new, separate chat: WhatsApp now often addresses chats
  with anonymous @lid IDs instead of phone numbers; these are now resolved
  back to the phone number so chats no longer split (thanks rdomschk!)
- Fix chat entries with multi-line last messages painting over the next
  entry in the chat list ("overlapping text"; thanks defactofactotum!)

* Sun Jul 12 2026 smatkovi <smatkovi@users.noreply.github.com> 0.3.1-1
- Fix chat view not scrolling to the latest message: positionViewAtEnd()
  was called before the SilicaListView finished layouting; now a short
  Timer positions the view at the last chat bubble, so it is always
  visible without manual scrolling (thanks for the community report!)

* Sat Jul 11 2026 smatkovi <smatkovi@users.noreply.github.com> 0.3.0-1
- Update whatsmeow to 2026-07-09: fixes pairing and login failing with
  "Client outdated (405)", which made new pairings impossible
- Show pairing errors in the UI instead of failing silently when
  tapping "Start pairing"
- Backend is now statically linked including SQLCipher (no external
  sqlcipher dependency required anymore)
